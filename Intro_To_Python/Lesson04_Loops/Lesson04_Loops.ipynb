    "### Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "**Loops are powerful**. They are a necessity for coding. Some coding languages, like C++, C and Fortran, are extremely efficient when executing loops. Python is less efficient, but in many algorithms loops are necessary. In the next lesson when we learn about arrays, we'll see that some loops can be turned into single lines using NumPy. But the basic idea behind those array operations is a loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "In python, the simplest loop you can do is a `while` loop. Using a Boolean argument (see Lesson 3), the code can repeat over and over until the Boolean argument is `False`. That's the definition of a loop; the code does some lines of code again and again. \n",

    "The key part of the code is `while count < StopNumber:` if `count` never got above `StopNumber` then the code would keep going. A horrible thing to do is `while True:` Python will just run the code forever, as fast as it can. It could crash your computer! \n",

    "In fact, as you increase the upper limit in `range(3,1000)` you'll notice the code takes longer to run (I do not recommend going above 100000). This is because of that nested loop. Since we add to the primes list, we make that inner loop of `y in primes` take longer every time we find a new prime number. This is an exponential growth in code run time. \n",

Therefore, for the number 2000, we check 2 on the first time through `y in primes`. Since 2000 % 2 = 0, we know 2000 is not prime. By adding the `break`, the code does not continue to look through the primes list. It jumps out of the `y in primes` loop. Taking out that break statement will make the code take longer to run. \n",
