#Hello Students! I hope this python file finds you healthy and ready to learn!
#Section 1: Variables & Data types
var1 = 3.14

var1 = 'Hi my name is Roark'


#Section 2: Printing
#Python3 treats print as a function. Hopefully this is the python version you
#have installed
#A function takes in input and then provides output.
print("Hello World")

#Python 2 does not treat print as a function.
#In python2, 'print "Hello World"' is the correct syntax

#For print, the parameter you pass into the function
#is the string or number or array that you want printed
p = print("Hello World")
print(p)
#In detail, print actually has no output! It returns None which is not any kind of variable.
#None is not even a string!

#Let's look at variables. Python is unlike C-based languages,
#becuase you do not have to declare the data type of the string.

i = 10
x = -5.0
