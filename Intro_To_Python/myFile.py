#Python3 treats print as a function. 
#Python 2 does not. In python2, 'print "Hello World"' is the correct syntax
print("Hello World")
#A function takes in input and then provides output.
#For print, the parameter is the string or number or array that you want printed
p = print("Hello World")
print(p)
#In detail, print actually has no output! It returns None which is not any kind of variable.
#None is not even a string! 

#Let's look at variables. Python is unlike C-based languages,
#becuase you do not have to declare the data type of the string.

i = 10
x = -5.0
